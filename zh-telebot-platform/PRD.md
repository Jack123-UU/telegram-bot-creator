## Design Direction

The design should feel modern and professional with a slight tech-forward edge, conveying reliability and sophistication. A minimal interface serves the complex functionality best, allowing users to focus on bot management without visual clutter.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using blue, orange, and green to represent different functional areas (monitoring, configuration, deployment) while maintaining visual harmony.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.5 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust, technology, and stability for main actions
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Warm Orange (oklch(0.7 0.12 50)) - For alerts, deployment status, and call-to-action elements
  - Fresh Green (oklch(0.6 0.14 140)) - For success states, active bots, and positive metrics
- **Accent Color**: Electric Blue (oklch(0.6 0.2 220)) - For highlighting active elements and focus states
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (oklch(0.98 0.005 240)): Dark Blue text (oklch(0.2 0.05 240)) - Ratio 12.3:1 ✓
  - Card (oklch(1 0 0)): Primary text (oklch(0.25 0.05 240)) - Ratio 11.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (oklch(0.5 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (oklch(0.95 0.02 240)): Dark text (oklch(0.3 0.05 240)) - Ratio 9.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (oklch(0.6 0.2 220)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey technical competence while remaining approachable - Inter provides excellent readability for data-heavy interfaces while maintaining a modern, professional appearance.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Dashboard Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (General Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Metrics/Labels): Inter Medium/14px/tight line height
  - Code (Bot Commands): JetBrains Mono/14px/monospace spacing

## Animations

Subtle and purposeful animations that enhance understanding of system state changes and guide attention to important updates - smooth transitions reinforce the reliability of the bot management system.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates system activity (bots coming online, deployments in progress) and reinforces the dynamic nature of bot management
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Status changes and real-time updates deserve primary animation focus, with secondary attention to navigation transitions
